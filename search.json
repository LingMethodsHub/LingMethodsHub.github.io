Set a username\nYou will need to set a username for Ubuntu on your first launch. It doesn’t have to be the same as your Windows username, but you might as well make it the same just to keep things easy. Just type in the username you want, and hit enter.\n\n\n4. Set a password\nYou’ll also need to set a password for your Ubuntu account.
