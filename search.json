However, we will only add content submodules from our own team account’s repositories, meaning we need to fork external repositories. We are doing this for a few reasons.\n\nUpdates and maintenance to the site may require non-content edits to tutorial repositories (e.g. updating yaml headers, reorganizing files). If a tutorial submodule was directly added from an external account, we would have to wait on that maintainer to accept a pull request for the content to update appropriately on the website.\nIn a reverse situation, if we added a submodule from an external account, and that account maintainer updated their repository to contain unwanted content, that content could wind up in the site when we update the submodules.\n\n\n\nWhat if I want to make edits after LingMethodsHub has forked the repository?\nYou may want to make edits to the tutorial repository after we have forked it for a few reasons, including\n\nEditing the content.\nUpdating the code.\nUpdating your personal metadata (name, url, affiliation, etc).\n\nThat is all fine to do in your own original repository. Once you’ve made updates as you see fit, just send us a pull request and we can merge the updated version of the tutorial into the site’s version.\n\n\nWhat if something looks wrong on the site?\nInevitably something won’t look quite right on the site. Submit github issue and we will try to sort it out."
