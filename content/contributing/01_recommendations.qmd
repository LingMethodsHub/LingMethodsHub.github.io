## Recommended contribution structure

If your contribution is a one pager, just put the content in a `index.md` or `index.qmd` file. If there are multiple parts, still include a `index.md` file which links to each part. Include each part as just a sequentially named `.md` or `.qmd` file. For examle:

    repo/
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── 00_part1.qmd
    ├── 01_part2.qmd
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── assets/
    └── index.md

## Recommended `.gitignore`

Either be careful not to commit any rendered documents to your repository, or be sure to exclude them with `.gitignore`.

``` .gitignore
*_files/
*.html
*.pdf
_site/
.ipynb_checkpoints/
.quarto/
.Rproj_user
*.Rproj
```
