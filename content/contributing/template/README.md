# Template

This is intended to be a tutorial template for the Linguistics Methods Hub. You can fork and rename this repository, then proceed to delete and rename files as works best for your needs. There is some useful information included in each sample document.

## Display order

If your tutorial has just one page, I'd recommend calling it `index.[qmd|Rmd|md|ipynb]` so that your url will appear like `https://lingmethodshub.github.io/content/r/tutorial`. If you have multiple pages to your tutorial, and it's not obvious from their file names what order they should go in, please include that information in the readme.

### Intended Display Order

1.  `index.qmd`
2.  `00_rmarkdown_template.Rmd`
3.  `01_qmd_template.qmd`
4.  `02_jupyter.ipynb`
