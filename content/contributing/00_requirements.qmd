## License

In order for your contribution to be added, it must be appropriately licensed, meaning you've included a `license` name in the yaml header of each content page, and there is a matching `LICENSE` document in the repository. It should at least be CC-BY-4.0, and we would recommend CC-BY-SA-4.0.

To add the license to your documents' yaml header, just add

``` yaml
license: "CC-BY-SA-4.0"
```

To add a license file, you can get it with `curl` in your terminal like so:

``` bash
curl https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode.txt > LICENSE
```

## Format

Your tutorial repository must contain source files that are renderable by quarto, which include

-   `.md` \| markdown files

-   `.qmd` \| quarto markdown files

-   `.Rmd` \| R Markdown files

-   `.ipynb` \| Jupyter notebooks
