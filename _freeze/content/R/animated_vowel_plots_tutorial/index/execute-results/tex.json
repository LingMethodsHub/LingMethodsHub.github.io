This\ndataset contains first and second formant data for 100 speakers of New\nZealand English (for details see [supplementaries for Brand et al.\n2021](https://osf.io/q4j29/)). The data can be found\n[here](anon_ONZE_mean_sample.rds){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nFor the purposes of this post any similar data set would be fine. We\nneed:\n\n-   first and second formant data,\n-   a range of vowels (we'll only look at monophthongs here),\n-   a time variables (whether year of birth, age category, or time\n    through recording), and\n-   any variables you wish to control for.\n\nLet's [load the libraries](renv.lock){target=\"_blank\"} we will use and\nhave a look at the data.\n\n``` r\n#| eval: false\n# Load renv environment\nrenv::use(lockfile = \"renv.lock\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load tidyverse and friends.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.5.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.5.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.5.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.5.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(gganimate)\n\n# mgcv will be used for fitting gamms later and itsadug for visualisation\nlibrary(mgcv)\nlibrary(itsadug)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'itsadug' was built under R version 4.5.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'plotfunctions' was built under R version 4.5.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# kable for displaying the dataset.\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\nvowels <- read_rds('anon_ONZE_mean_sample.rds')\n\nvowels %>%\n  head(10) %>%\n  kable() %>%\n  kable_styling(font_size = 11) %>%\n  scroll_box(width = \"100%\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\\fontsize{11}{13}\\selectfont\n\n\\begin{longtable}[t]{llrrrlr}\n\\toprule\nSpeaker & Vowel & F1\\_50 & F2\\_50 & Speech\\_rate & Gender & yob\\\\\n\\midrule\nCC\\_f\\_020 & DRESS & 622.5797 & 1897.986 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & FLEECE & 518.7458 & 1882.763 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & GOOSE & 524.0606 & 1944.152 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & KIT & 646.8214 & 1790.054 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & LOT & 735.3438 & 1262.969 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\n\\addlinespace\nCC\\_f\\_020 & NURSE & 534.8571 & 1912.714 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & START & 888.3929 & 1604.750 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & STRUT & 831.9661 & 1511.373 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & THOUGHT & 594.5000 & 1051.571 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & TRAP & 637.8667 & 1816.833 & 4.9264 & F & 1936\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup{}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this dataset each row is a vowel token, with columns:\n\n-   `F1_50` and `F2_50`: F1 and F2, taken at the midpoint measured in\n    Hz,\n-   `Vowel`: Wells lexical set labels for New Zealand English\n    monophthongs,\n-   `yob`: participant year of birth (our time variable),\n-   `Speech_rate`: the average speech rate of the participant across the\n    recording (a control variable),\n-   `Speaker`: a code indicating which speaker the token comes from\n    (sometimes useful as a random effect), and\n-   `Gender`: the gender of the speaker (in this case, an `M`/`F`\n    binary).\n\nIn any real research project, you will need to engage in a lot of data\nexploration here. Do you have good data coverage? Is there evidence of\noutliers in the data? Does the data need to be normalised? This is the\ntime to ask this kind of question. The answers will, of course, depend\non your research questions. For this post, the only point of this data\nis to illustrate a method for modelling and visualising. We can skip\nthese questions!\n\nWe will now fit separate models for the F1 and F2 of each vowel. Rather\nthan using a big `for` loop, or fitting each model with a separate line\nof code, we will use the `purrr` method of *nesting* our data so that we\nhave a row for each of the models we want to fit, fit the models, and\nthen *unnest* to produce data which can be used to visualise our model.\n**We nest, we mutate, and we unnest.** This is a common pattern with\n`purrr`.\n\nBefore we nest, we need to slightly modify our data. Rather than having\na column for our F1 data and a column for our F2 data, we want to\ncapture there in *rows*. That is, we need our table to be *longer*.\nThere will then be two rows for each token, one for the F1 and one for\nthe F2.\n\nTo do this, we use the trusty `dplyr` function `pivot_longer()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvowels <- vowels %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = F1_50:F2_50, # Select the columns to turn into rows.\n    names_to = \"Formant\", # Name the column to indicate if data is F1 or F2,\n    values_to = \"Frequency\"\n  )\n\nvowels %>%\n  head(10) %>%\n  kable() %>%\n  kable_styling(font_size = 11) %>%\n  scroll_box(width = \"100%\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\\fontsize{11}{13}\\selectfont\n\n\\begin{longtable}[t]{llrlrlr}\n\\toprule\nSpeaker & Vowel & Speech\\_rate & Gender & yob & Formant & Frequency\\\\\n\\midrule\nCC\\_f\\_020 & DRESS & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F1\\_50 & 622.5797\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & DRESS & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F2\\_50 & 1897.9855\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & FLEECE & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F1\\_50 & 518.7458\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & FLEECE & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F2\\_50 & 1882.7627\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & GOOSE & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F1\\_50 & 524.0606\\\\\n\\addlinespace\nCC\\_f\\_020 & GOOSE & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F2\\_50 & 1944.1515\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & KIT & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F1\\_50 & 646.8214\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & KIT & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F2\\_50 & 1790.0536\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & LOT & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F1\\_50 & 735.3438\\\\\nCC\\_f\\_020 & LOT & 4.9264 & F & 1936 & F2\\_50 & 1262.9688\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup{}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs the table above shows, we now have a column indicating whether a\nfrequency value is an F1 or an F2 reading.\n\n### Nest\n\nWe now nest the data. We do this by grouping the data by the columns\nwhich identify the models we want to fit. In this case, we fit an F1 and\nan F2 model for each vowel. So the columns we need to identify our\nmodels are `Vowel` and `Formant`. Once we've grouped, we simply use the\nfunction `nest()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvowels <- vowels %>%\n  group_by(Vowel, Formant) %>%\n  nest()\n  \nvowels\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 20 x 3\n# Groups:   Vowel, Formant [20]\n   Vowel   Formant data              \n   <fct>   <chr>   <list>            \n 1 DRESS   F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n 2 DRESS   F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n 3 FLEECE  F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n 4 FLEECE  F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n 5 GOOSE   F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n 6 GOOSE   F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n 7 KIT     F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n 8 KIT     F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n 9 LOT     F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n10 LOT     F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n11 NURSE   F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n12 NURSE   F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n13 START   F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n14 START   F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n15 STRUT   F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n16 STRUT   F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n17 THOUGHT F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n18 THOUGHT F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n19 TRAP    F1_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n20 TRAP    F2_50   <tibble [100 x 5]>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe output above shows that we now have a three column data frame (or,\nin tidyverse speak, a tibble), with the familiar columns `Vowel` and\n`Formant` and a new column `data`. The column `data` contains tibbles\nwhich live *inside* our tibble. That is, *nested* tibbles. These contain\nthe data which we will use to model each vowel and formant separately.\n\n### Mutate (and Map)\n\nWe can perform actions on the tibbles in the `data` column by using\n`mutate` (just as we would modify other data in a tibble). In this case\nwe will create a column to store our models. The basic structure will\nlook something like this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvowels <- vowels %>%\n  mutate(\n    model = #???\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe question marks can be filled in with the `map()` function. This\nenables us to apply a function to fit a model to each of our nested\ntibbles.\n\nSo, what will this function look like? This is not the place for a\ntutorial on GAMs (for which, go\n[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05339)). We will fit a model which\npredicts formant frequency from the gender of each participant, their\nyear of birth, and their average speech rate. One way to implement this\nstructure in `mgcv` is with the formula\n`Frequency ~ Gender + s(yob, by=Gender) + s(Speech_rate)`.\n\nThis structure will be the same for *all* of our nested tibbles. The\nonly thing that will change is the data fed in to it. In this kind of\ncase, we can use `~` to turn our model expression into a function and\n`.x` as a pronoun for the nested tibbles. Let's see what this look like\nand then explain further:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvowels <- vowels %>%\n  mutate(\n    model = map(\n      data, # We are applying a function to the entries of the `data` column.\n      # This is the function we are applying (introduced with a ~)\n      ~ bam( \n          # Here's our formula.\n          Frequency ~ Gender + \n            s(yob, by=Gender, k=5) + \n            s(Speech_rate, k=5),\n          data = .x, # Here's our pronoun.\n          # Then some arguments to speed up the model fit.\n          method = 'fREML',\n          discrete = TRUE,\n          nthreads = 2\n      )\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: There were 20 warnings in `mutate()`.\nThe first warning was:\ni In argument: `model = map(...)`.\ni In group 1: `Vowel = DRESS` `Formant = \"F1_50\"`.\nCaused by warning in `bam()`:\n! openMP not available: single threaded computation only\ni Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 19 remaining warnings.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function `bam` is one of the main functions for fitting GAMM models\nin `mgcv`. It is often used for large data sets. Our use of `~` creates\na function which is applied to each of our nested tibbles. The entries\nin `model` are created by taking the corresponding tibble in the `data`\ncolumn and applying the function to it. The tibble is referred to by the\npronoun `.x` in the function. In the above, `.x` is used as the data fed\nto `bam()`. So, for the row of our tibble with `DRESS` and `F1_50` in\nthe `Vowel` and `Formant` columns, the entry for `model` will be a model\nproduced from the data for [dress]{.smallcaps} and F1.\n\nNote that you can use any modelling function you like here. The general\nstrategy of nesting and fitting models doesn't have any special\nconnections with GAMs or `mgcv`. You could fit a linear model with `lm`\nor a generalised linear model using the `lme4` package.\n\nWe now have GAMM models for each of these vowels. These are stored in\nthe `model` column we have just created. We can check out one of these\nmodels using the `itsadug` `plot_smooth()` function as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_smooth(\n  vowels$model[[7]], # Pick the first entry in the model column.\n  view = \"yob\", # The x-axis variable.  \n  plot_all = \"Gender\",\n  main= paste(vowels$Vowel[[7]], vowels$Formant[[7]])\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSummary:\n\t* Gender : factor; set to the value(s): F, M. \n\t* yob : numeric predictor; with 30 values ranging from 1864.000000 to 1981.000000. \n\t* Speech_rate : numeric predictor; set to the value(s): 4.5118. \n\t* NOTE : No random effects in the model to cancel.\n \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Smooth plot for KIT F1](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-smooth-plot-1.pdf){#fig-smooth-plot fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-smooth-plot shows a well known feature of the development of New\nZealand English: the centralisation of the [kit]{.smallcaps} vowel. It\nalso indicates something to keep in mind when fitting non-linear models.\nThe wiggles in the smooth for the female speakers might simply be over\nfitting our particular sample. Again, this is illustrative of a general\npattern, each step of which requires criticism in practice!\n\nFor the purpose of visualisation, we want predictions from our model to\nplot. To do this, we map again. This time, we use the `itsadug` function\n`get_predictions()` instead of the `mgcv` function `bam()`, but the\nunderlying idea is the same. The function `get_predictions()` needs us\nto tell it what values we want predictions for. In this case, we want\npredictions for the full range of years of birth in our data set\n(1864-1981) *and* for both genders.\n\nThe following code stores the values we want predictions for in the\n`to_predict` object and then creates a `prediction` column using\n`mutate()` and `map()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nto_predict <- list(\n  \"yob\" = seq(from=1864, to=1981, by=1), # All years\n  \"Gender\" = c(\"M\", \"F\")\n) \n# BTW: Get prediction will just assume the average value for any predictors not\n# mentioned (in this case, Speech_rate).\n\nvowels <- vowels %>%\n  mutate(\n    prediction = map(\n      model, # This time we're applying the function to all the models.\n      # We again introduce the function with '~', and indicate where the model \n      # goes with '.x'.\n      ~ get_predictions(model = .x, cond = to_predict, print.summary = FALSE)\n    )\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo what does a tibble of predictions look like?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvowels$prediction[[1]] %>%\n  head() %>%\n  kable() %>%\n  kable_styling() %>%\n  scroll_box(width = \"100%\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\\begin{longtable}[t]{lrrrr}\n\\toprule\nGender & yob & Speech\\_rate & fit & CI\\\\\n\\midrule\nM & 1864 & 4.4873 & 501.5480 & 27.00804\\\\\nF & 1864 & 4.4873 & 570.1079 & 36.38487\\\\\nM & 1865 & 4.4873 & 501.0873 & 26.68430\\\\\nF & 1865 & 4.4873 & 569.3392 & 35.95156\\\\\nM & 1866 & 4.4873 & 500.6266 & 26.36302\\\\\n\\addlinespace\nF & 1866 & 4.4873 & 568.5705 & 35.51985\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs expected, we get a predicted value for each gender in each of the\nyears spanned by the data.\n\n### Unnest\n\nIn order to visualise the predictions of our models, we need to *unnest*\nthis data set. We will do this in a slightly non-standard way, by making\na new unnested tibble at this stage rather than modifying our original\ntibble again. But the same principles apply.\n\nIn this case, we need to select our identifying variables (`Vowel` and\n`Formant`) and the column with the data we want access to in a\nnon-nested form (for us, `prediction`). We unnest as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictions <- vowels %>%\n  select(\n    Vowel, Formant, prediction\n  ) %>%\n  unnest(prediction)\n\npredictions %>%\n  head() %>%\n  kable() %>%\n  kable_styling() %>%\n  scroll_box(width = \"100%\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\\begin{longtable}[t]{lllrrrr}\n\\toprule\nVowel & Formant & Gender & yob & Speech\\_rate & fit & CI\\\\\n\\midrule\nDRESS & F1\\_50 & M & 1864 & 4.4873 & 501.5480 & 27.00804\\\\\nDRESS & F1\\_50 & F & 1864 & 4.4873 & 570.1079 & 36.38487\\\\\nDRESS & F1\\_50 & M & 1865 & 4.4873 & 501.0873 & 26.68430\\\\\nDRESS & F1\\_50 & F & 1865 & 4.4873 & 569.3392 & 35.95156\\\\\nDRESS & F1\\_50 & M & 1866 & 4.4873 & 500.6266 & 26.36302\\\\\n\\addlinespace\nDRESS & F1\\_50 & F & 1866 & 4.4873 & 568.5705 & 35.51985\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur tibble now has our predicted values along with the `Vowel` and\n`Formant` information which identifies which model they came from.\n\nNote that we have now thrown away our individual speaker information.\nThis is often the case when visualising models of this sort as we are\nnot interested in predicting the speech of this or that particular\nspeaker in our data set. Rather, we want to say something about NZE\nspeech *in general*.\n\nWe are now in a position to *visualise* changes in the overall NZE vowel\nspace.\n\n## Visualise Model Predictions as a Vowel Space\n\nWe first produce a static plot using a standard `ggplot` approach and\nthen produce an animation using `gganimate`.\n\nWe begin by defining a colour scheme (following @brand2021, again).\nThese use html colour codes (plenty of explanations are available\nonline).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvowel_colours <- c(\n  DRESS = \"#9590FF\",\n  FLEECE = \"#D89000\",\n  GOOSE = \"#A3A500\",\n  KIT = \"#39B600\",\n  LOT = \"#00BF7D\",\n  NURSE = \"#00BFC4\",\n  START = \"#00B0F6\",\n  STRUT = \"#F8766D\",\n  THOUGHT = \"#E76BF3\",\n  TRAP = \"#FF62BC\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe also need to reverse our previous use of `pivot_longer()`. Why? Well\nvowel spaces have F1 as the *y*-axis and F2 as the *x*-axis. This\nrequires F1 and F2 to be distinct columns. To do this, we use\n`pivot_wider()`. This is made easier if we remove the columns we will\nnot use for plotting first.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictions <- predictions %>%\n  select( # Remove unneeded variables\n    -Speech_rate,\n    -CI\n  ) %>%\n  pivot_wider( # Pivot\n    names_from = Formant,\n    values_from = fit\n  )\n\npredictions %>%\n  head() %>%\n  kable() %>%\n  kable_styling() %>%\n  scroll_box(width = \"100%\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\\begin{longtable}[t]{llrrr}\n\\toprule\nVowel & Gender & yob & F1\\_50 & F2\\_50\\\\\n\\midrule\nDRESS & M & 1864 & 501.5480 & 1657.465\\\\\nDRESS & F & 1864 & 570.1079 & 1964.213\\\\\nDRESS & M & 1865 & 501.0873 & 1659.390\\\\\nDRESS & F & 1865 & 569.3392 & 1966.005\\\\\nDRESS & M & 1866 & 500.6266 & 1661.316\\\\\n\\addlinespace\nDRESS & F & 1866 & 568.5705 & 1967.797\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Static Plot\n\nThe plot we eventually produce is quite complex. Let's start with\ndepicting the data in two-dimensions using points and only plotting the\nfemale speakers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictions %>%\n  # Filter so only female speakers are plotted.\n  filter(\n    Gender == \"F\"\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = F2_50,\n      y = F1_50,\n      colour = Vowel\n    )\n  ) +\n  # Add the points\n  geom_point() +\n  # Change the colours for the vowels to match those defined above.\n  scale_colour_manual(values = vowel_colours)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-12-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is the wrong way around for a vowel plot. So we reverse the *x* and\n*y* axes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictions %>%\n  filter(\n    Gender == \"F\"\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = F2_50,\n      y = F1_50,\n      colour = Vowel\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = vowel_colours)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-13-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's also unclear which direction these changes are occurring. We need\nto swap out `geom_point()` for something directed. In this case, we use\n`geom_path()` and `arrow()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictions %>%\n  filter(\n    Gender == \"F\"\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = F2_50,\n      y = F1_50,\n      colour = Vowel\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_path(arrow = arrow(length = unit(5, \"mm\"))) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = vowel_colours)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-14-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can add labels to the start of each arrow and remove the legend. This\nis found by some to be a more clear vowel plot. To do this, we have to\npick out the first observation of each vowel in a new tibble. This\nprevents us from labelling *every* point on the line.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfirst_obs <- predictions %>%\n  group_by(Vowel, Gender) %>%\n  slice(which.min(yob))\n\npredictions %>%\n  filter(\n    Gender == \"F\"\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = F2_50,\n      y = F1_50,\n      colour = Vowel,\n      label = Vowel # Add label to the aesthetics.\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_path(\n    arrow = arrow(length = unit(5, \"mm\")),\n    show.legend = FALSE # Remove legend\n  ) +\n  geom_label(\n    # Note filtering as we are only dealing with female speakers now.\n    data = first_obs %>% filter(Gender == \"F\"), \n    show.legend = FALSE # Again remove legend.\n  ) +\n  # Often need to use 'expansion' here to fit in 'THOUGHT'\n  scale_x_reverse(expand = expansion(add = 100)) + \n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = vowel_colours)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can use the faceting functions to plot both male and female data. We\nuse the `facet_grid()` function. **NB**: this requires us to remove the\n`filter()` functions from the above.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictions %>%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = F2_50,\n      y = F1_50,\n      colour = Vowel,\n      label = Vowel\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_path(\n    arrow = arrow(length = unit(5, \"mm\")),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_label(\n    data = first_obs, \n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  scale_x_reverse(expand = expansion(add = 250)) + \n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = vowel_colours) +\n  facet_grid(\n    cols = vars(Gender)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are still a few shortcomings here. We have overlap of the labels,\nwhich are now a little large. We attempt to fix this, while also adding\na call to `labs()` to properly label the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictions %>%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = F2_50,\n      y = F1_50,\n      colour = Vowel,\n      label = Vowel\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_path(\n    arrow = arrow(length = unit(2.5, \"mm\")), # Make arrows smaller\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_label(\n    data = first_obs, \n    show.legend = FALSE,\n    size = 2.5, # Make labels smaller...\n    alpha = 0.7 # ...and slightly transparent.\n  ) +\n  scale_x_reverse(expand = expansion(add = 200)) + # less expanasion needed.\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = vowel_colours) +\n  facet_grid(\n    cols = vars(Gender)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Vowel Space Change in NZE (yob: 1864-1981)\",\n    x = \"First Formant (Hz)\",\n    y = \"Second Formant (Hz)\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-17-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis figure is a good starting point for the kind of smaller adjustments\nneeded to produce a good vowel space visualisation. In your own cases, a\nlot will depend on the specifics of the models and how much change is\nbeing depicted. In this case, it would be nice to make some of these\nlines a little less messy. Some of the problems here, for instance, the\nmessy lines for [start]{.smallcaps} and [strut]{.smallcaps} in the male\nspeakers, suggest that our models might be behaving a strangely. This is\nnot a problem for this illustration, but some model criticism would be\nrequired in a real research project!\n\n### Animation\n\nOne problem with the static plot is that we can't see variation in the\nrate of change (if any exists). Nor can we figure out, for any point on\nthe line (apart from the start and end) which year it represents. This\ncan be fixed with the\n[`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html) package.\n\nWe use the `gganimate` function `transition_reveal()` at the end of our\nplot with `yob` as the variable we animate with. Our `geom_label()`, the\ntext with the vowel name, will be the main item we animate. The labels\nwill move around the vowel space over time. We change our `geom_path()`\nso that it has no arrows and simply traces where the label of the vowel\nmoves.\n\nWe add a caption to our `labs()` in which we reference the `gganimate`\nvariable `frames_along`. This allows us to show what year it is.\nFinally, a call to `theme()` lets us make this caption larger.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredictions %>%\n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = F2_50,\n      y = F1_50,\n      colour = Vowel,\n      label = Vowel\n    )\n  ) +\n  geom_path(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  # NB: our labels just use the predictions dataframe now, so no need for the\n  # 'data = ' line.\n  geom_label( \n    show.legend = FALSE,\n    size = 2.5, \n    alpha = 0.7 \n  ) +\n  scale_x_reverse(expand = expansion(add = 200)) + \n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = vowel_colours) +\n  facet_grid(\n    cols = vars(Gender)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Vowel Space Change in NZE (yob: 1864-1981)\",\n    x = \"First Formant (Hz)\",\n    y = \"Second Formant (Hz)\",\n    caption = 'Year of Birth: {round(frame_along, 0)}' \n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0)\n  ) +\n  transition_reveal(along = yob)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo there is it: a general structure for fitting models to visualise\nchanges in vowel formants over time, and for plotting them within vowel\nspace diagrams.\n\nAs I've noted multiple times above, the details will matter at every\nstep in a real research project. Data quality assessment before\nmodelling, sensible model structures, evaluation of model quality, and\ncareful consideration of exactly what needs to be visualised are all\nnecessary.",
