This collection of packages is specifically focused on data science and offers some shortcuts that are useful to learn. The packages that make up the `tidyverse` are `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `purr`, `tibble`, `tidyr`, `stingr`, `readr`, and `forcats`, among others. Throughout this guide I try to use the most basic *R* syntax for accomplishing a task. This way you learn how *R* works. I will also show how to complete the same task using packages from the `tidyverse`. Using the `tidyverse` methods is usually optional --- though once you get the hang of it, you might always use the `tidyverse` methods.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install the tidyverse package\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the tidyverse package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# List the packages loaded by the tidyverse package\ntidyverse_packages()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"broom\"         \"conflicted\"    \"cli\"           \"dbplyr\"       \n [5] \"dplyr\"         \"dtplyr\"        \"forcats\"       \"ggplot2\"      \n [9] \"googledrive\"   \"googlesheets4\" \"haven\"         \"hms\"          \n[13] \"httr\"          \"jsonlite\"      \"lubridate\"     \"magrittr\"     \n[17] \"modelr\"        \"pillar\"        \"purrr\"         \"ragg\"         \n[21] \"readr\"         \"readxl\"        \"reprex\"        \"rlang\"        \n[25] \"rstudioapi\"    \"rvest\"         \"stringr\"       \"tibble\"       \n[29] \"tidyr\"         \"xml2\"          \"tidyverse\"    \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBefore we get started with the `tidyverse`, there are two important new things to learn about. The first is the pipe operator `%>%` and the second is the the alternative to a *data frame* called a *tibble*.\n\n### The Pipe %\\>%\n\nThe pipe operator `%>%`[^1] is introduced by the `magrittr` package[^2] and it is extremely useful. The pipe operator passes the output of a function to the first argument of the next function, which mean you can chain several steps together.\n\n[^1]: Not to be confused with the operator `|`, which means \"or\" and whose symbol is also called \"pipe\".\n\n[^2]: Loading `dplyr` will also let you use it.\n\nFor example, lets find the mean year of birth in our data. We already know that when the pre-vowel contexts are removed, the mean year of birth is 1969.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Get the data first\nIf you don't have the `td` data loaded in *R*, go back to [Getting Your Data into *R*](https://lingmethodshub.github.io/content/R/lvc_r/020_lvcr.html) and run the code. \n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find mean YOB using mean() function\nmean(td$YOB)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1969.447\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find the mean YOB by piping the td data to the mean() function\ntd$YOB %>% mean()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1969.447\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe functionality of `%>%` might seem trivial at this point; however, when you need to perform multiple tasks sequentially, it saves a lot of time and space when writing your code.\n\n### Tibbles\n\nA *tibble* is an updated version of a *data frame*. *Tibbles* keep the features that have stood the test of time, and drop the features that used to be convenient but are now frustrating (i.e. converting character vectors to factors). For our purposes, the difference between the two is negligible, but you should be aware that *tibbles* look a bit different from *data frames*. Run these two commands and compare. \n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas.data.frame(td)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output

The `glipmpse()` function is like a cross between `print()` (which shows the data) and `str()` (which shows the structure of the data). I use `glimpse()` almost as frequently as I use `summary()`. In fact, if you have very wide data, i.e., with lots of columns, `glimpse()` may prove more useful than `summary()` for getting a quick snapshot of your data. `glimpse()` shows the number of rows, the number of columns, the name of each column, its class, and however many values in each column as will fit horizontally in the console.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(td)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 1,189\nColumns: 17\n$ Dep.Var      <chr> \"Realized\", \"Deletion\", \"Deletion\", \"Deletion\", \"Realized…\n$ Stress       <chr> \"Stressed\", \"Stressed\", \"Stressed\", \"Stressed\", \"Stressed…\n$ Category     <chr> \"Lexical\", \"Lexical\", \"Lexical\", \"Lexical\", \"Lexical\", \"L…\n$ Morph.Type   <chr> \"Mono\", \"Mono\", \"Mono\", \"Mono\", \"Mono\", \"Mono\", \"Mono\", \"…\n$ Before       <fct> Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop, Sto…\n$ After        <chr> \"Consonant\", \"Consonant\", \"Consonant\", \"Consonant\", \"Cons…\n$ Speaker      <chr> \"BOUF65\", \"CHIF55\", \"CHIF55\", \"CLAF52\", \"DONM53\", \"DONM58…\n$ YOB          <int> 1965, 1955, 1955, 1952, 1953, 1958, 1946, 1942, 1945, 194…\n$ Sex          <chr> \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"M\", \"M\", \"F\", \"M\", \"M\", \"F\", \"M\", \"M…\n$ Education    <chr> \"Educated\", \"Educated\", \"Educated\", \"Educated\", \"Educated…\n$ Job          <chr> \"White\", \"White\", \"White\", \"Service\", \"Service\", \"Service…\n$ After.New    <fct> Consonant, Consonant, Consonant, Consonant, Consonant, Co…\n$ Center.Age   <dbl> -4.446594, -14.446594, -14.446594, -17.446594, -16.446594…\n$ Age.Group    <fct> Middle, Middle, Middle, Middle, Middle, Middle, Middle, O…\n$ Age_Sex      <fct> Middle_F, Middle_F, Middle_F, Middle_F, Middle_M, Middle_…\n$ Phoneme      <fct> t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, …\n$ Dep.Var.Full <fct> T, Deletion, Deletion, Deletion, T, Deletion, Deletion, D…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Manipulating data with `dplyr`\n\nThe `dplyr` package is great for manipulating data in a data frame/tibble.

The `breaks=` option is a concatenated list of boundaries. It should start and end with `-Inf` and `Inf` (negative and positive infinity) as these will be the lower and upper bounds. The other values are the boundaries or cut-off points. By default `cut()` has the setting `right=TRUE`, which means the boundary values are considered the last value in a group (e.g., rightmost value). Above, this means `1944` will be the highest value in the `Old` category and `1979` will the the highest value in the `Middle` category. To reverse this you can add the option `right=FALSE` in which case 1944 would be the lowest value in the `Middle` category (e.g. leftmost value) and 1979 would be the lowest value in the `Young` category.\n\nLet's continue.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Combine Age and Sex: use the unite() function from the tidyr package, if remove=TRUE the original Age.Group and Sex columns will be deleted\ntd <-td %>% \n     unite(\"Age_Sex\", c(Age.Group, Sex), sep= \"_\", remove = FALSE) \n    \n# Break Phoneme.Dep.Var into two columns:\n# same as before, but with td passed to mutate() by the %>% operator\ntd <-td %>%\n mutate(Phoneme = sub(\"^(.)(--.*)$\", \"\\\\1\", \n        Phoneme.Dep.Var), \n        Dep.Var.Full = sub(\"^(.--)(.*)$\", \"\\\\2\", \n        Phoneme.Dep.Var), \n        Phoneme.Dep.Var = NULL) \n```\n:::\n\n\nAt this point we have done everything except partition the data and re-center YOB in the partitioned data frames. You may ask, \"How is this better?\". Well, the answer is that because all these modifications feed into one another, we can actually include them all together in one serialized operation. Behold!\n\nAll of the above code can be simplified as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nor...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in token file\ntd <- read.delim(\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jxlfuogea3lx2pu/deletiondata.txt?dl=1\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nthen...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Subset data to remove previous 'Vowel' contexts, \n# then modify several columns with mutate, \n# then convert any character column to a factor column\ntd <- td %>%\n      filter(Before != \"Vowel\")%>%\n      mutate(\n        After.New = recode(After, \"H\" = \"Consonant\"), \n        Center.Age = as.numeric(scale(YOB, scale = FALSE)), \n        Age.Group = cut(YOB, breaks = c(-Inf, 1944, 1979, Inf), \n                        labels = c(\"Old\", \"Middle\", \"Young\")), \n        Phoneme = sub(\"^(.)(--.*)$\", \"\\\\1\", Phoneme.Dep.Var), \n        Dep.Var.Full = sub(\"^(.--)(.*)$\", \"\\\\2\", Phoneme.Dep.Var), \n        Phoneme.Dep.Var = NULL\n        )%>%\n      mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, doesn't the above look so much cleaner and easier to follow? You'll notice that after some lines there is a `#`. This an optional way to signal the end of a line of code when your code is broken over more than one line. Above, the `mutate()` function could have been written in one single continuous line, but breaking it up over multiple lines makes seeing each mutation much easier. \n\nTo partition the data we still need separate functions. Also, remember to re-centre any continuous variables after partioning.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntd.young <- td %>% \n            filter(Age.Group == \"Young\")%>%\n            mutate(Center.Age = as.numeric(scale(YOB, scale = FALSE)))\n\ntd.middle <- td %>% \n             filter(Age.Group == \"Middle\")%>%\n             mutate(Center.Age = as.numeric(scale(YOB, scale = FALSE)))\n\ntd.old <- td %>% \n          filter(Age.Group == \"Old\")%>%\n          mutate(Center.Age = as.numeric(scale(YOB, scale = FALSE)))\n```\n:::\n\n",
